# Scripts for training Layout Detection Models using Detectron2

## Usage

- In `tools/`, we provide a series of handy scripts for converting data formats and training the models.
- In `scripts/`, it lists specific command for running the code for processing the given dataset. 
- The `configs/` contains the configuration for different deep learning models, and is organized by datasets.
